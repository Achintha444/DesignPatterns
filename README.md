# DesignPatterns
* This repo consists simple simulations of Design patterns such as (ex: State, Strategy)
* The language I have used is Java 8.
* Please be kind enough to let me know if I have made a mistake in the codes.

## References
* I strongly recommend if you don't have a clear idea about design patterns, before dive into the codes first to read and get the idea from these tutorials.
